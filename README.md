# üß∫ WashingMachineProject

**WashingMachineProject** is an IoT-based system designed to track the real-time availability of washing machines in shared laundry spaces like university hostels or residential complexes. This system enables users to check machine availability via a website or app, with a status update delay of no more than **2 minutes**.

This project is being developed using **non-invasive sensors** that monitor washing machine usage without modifying internal hardware, ensuring safety and ease of deployment.

## üöÄ Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Monitor whether a washing machine is **free** or **in use**
- Deliver this status information to users **remotely** through an app or website
- Ensure **status updates** are available with **less than 2 minutes delay**
- Use **non-invasive** and **cost-effective** sensor solutions

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by prototype versions, each represented by a folder like `proto1`, `proto2`, etc.

Each prototype folder contains:

- `hardware/`: Information about the circuitry, sensors, and microcontroller used
- `software/`: Microcontroller code and any additional scripts/software used for data transmission and collection

Please refer to the `README.md` or documentation files inside each `protoX/` folder for:

- Circuit diagrams
- Sensor details
- Known issues
- Setup instructions

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Microcontrollers** (e.g., ESP8266 / ESP32)
- **Non-invasive sensors** (e.g., vibration sensors, current clamps)
- **IoT protocols** (e.g., MQTT, HTTP)
- **Web/App interfaces** for user interaction
- **Cloud/database** integration for status tracking
