#  WashingMachineProject

**WashingMachineProject** is an IoT-based system designed to track the real-time availability of washing machines in shared laundry spaces like university hostels or residential complexes. This system enables users to check machine availability via a website or app, with a status update delay of no more than **2 minutes**.

This project is being developed using **non-invasive sensors** that monitor washing machine usage without modifying internal hardware, ensuring safety and ease of deployment.

##  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Monitor whether a washing machine is **free** or **in use**
- Deliver this status information to users **remotely** through an app or website
- Ensure **status updates** are available with **less than 2 minutes delay**
- Use **non-invasive** and **cost-effective** sensor solutions
