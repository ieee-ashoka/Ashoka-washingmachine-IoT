In this version we continued to use the SCT-013 till we realized that the sensor was rated for 30A.. well above our use-case. 
This version we added voltage biasing by using a voltage divider to make a non-zero baseline as we learned that the analogue input of an esp-32 cannot read negative voltages. We tried using external burden resistance to boost the output of the sensor. 
While this approach did work to some extent it still failed to pick up smaller current readings. We then tried to use an Arduino as an input amplifier where the sensor was connected to an Arduino (which had a much nicer and less noisy analogue input) and the values were "boosted" and sent to the esp analogue as a PWM signal. This worked to some extent but it failed to pick up the current reading during the "soak" part of the washing machine cycle.
